Zedit - A Short History
-----------------------

Back in 1988 I was using three editors on a daily basis. One for the
bulk of my editing, one for regular expressions, and one for large
files (memory maps mainly). I had access to an unused Unix workstation
so I started writing an Emacs like editor.

Once it was usable under Unix, I ported it to DOS and it became my
only editor.

The DOS version became fairly full-featured. In 1990 I joined
Toolsmiths and switched to Sun computers. Zedit grew and a raw X11
version and later a slightly better looking version where created.

In 1996 I joined Pika and didn't have the energy to port Zedit to
Windows NT, so it languished. I switched to GNU Emacs and then
XEmacs.

But it has morphed back into a nice little terminal only editor to use
for those quick edits of config files. Or for low powered machines.

About the Name
--------------

The program is called Zedit, but the executable was always z. I liked
the fact that if you say z the British/Canadian way (zed not zee) it
has the word ed in it but only needs one letter.

So why does the Makefile produce ze? When I worked at Toolsmiths other
developers used Zedit. When making changes, I would create ze (z
experimental) and when it was stable copy it over z. This way I didn't
affect other users. That has just stuck over the years.
