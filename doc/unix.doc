.sh 1 "BSD" 1

BSD does not pass the full path as the argv[0] argument to a program.
Therefore Zedit does not know the directory the executable is from. The
ZPATH environment variable should be set to the directory where the
default Zedit config, help, and bindings files are kept.

.sh 1 "Files"

Files are an important part of any editor, therefore, Zedit tries to
make file name entry as easy as possible. The Zedit file commands all
support file name completion. If you are typing in a file name and hit
<tab>, Zedit will try to complete the file name much like
Command Completion. A <space> will display all possible matches.

Zedit also understands:

.ip -
\. as the current directory. Note that Zedit defaults to the current
directory.

.ip -
\.. as the previous directory.

.ip -
~ as your home directory (using your real uid, not your effective uid).

.ip -
~<loginname> as the home directory for loginname.

Zedit limits a full path name to 128 characters.

For backups, Zedit appends a ~ to the filename. On SYS5 machines, it
will place the ~ at the 14th character.


.sh 1 "Shell Commands"

Zedit supports piped shells and makes on Unix machines. This allows you
to have a shell running at the same time as you are editing. It also
allows a make and editing at the same time or makes without leaving the
editor. It also allows you to perform Next Error commands while the make
is still in progress.



.sh 1 "Terminal Interfaces"

Zedit supports three standard Unix terminal interface definitions:
termcaps, terminfo, and ANSI.

Termcaps was the first standard terminal database for Unix. It is the
default for BSD machines. The database is a flat file which is read to
get the terminal characteristics.

Terminfo is a second standard terminal database that is compiled for
faster database access. It also supports a wider range of keys and
terminal characteristics.

The ANSI terminal interface emulates a basic vt100.


.sh 2 "Termcaps"

This section will describe what Zedit requires from termcap. It is
assumed the user nows what termcap is and how to configure it. A
description of the termcap database is in the Unix manual.

If you are running in a windowed environment and you resize the window
Zedit is running in, a Refresh will resize the Zedit windows to fit the
new screen size. This works on a Sun, it may not work on other computers.

To correctly display the text on the screen, Zedit needs some of the
termcap display variables. Zedit will not run if the termcap entry
cannot be found for your specified TERM variable. It also requires, at a
minimum, the 'cm', 'ce', and 'cl' variables. These define absolute
cursor addressing, clear to end of line, and clear to end of window
respectively. With these basic strings Zedit will operate. There are,
however, some other variables which may need to be set for correct
operation.

The first important optional variables are 'co' and 'li'. These define the
number of columns and lines on the terminal. If they are non-existent,
Zedit will default to 80 columns and 24 lines. Zedit also has a maximum
of 132 columns and 40 lines.

Another variable that is used if found is the terminal initialization
string, 'is'. This string is sent to the terminal at startup and may be
required to set modes correctly.

Zedit will also read the 'so' and 'se' variables to define the standout
and end standout mode strings. If these are defined, the mode line and
the Mark are displayed in standout (usually reverse video). If 'so' and 'se'
are not found, Zedit will display the mode line and Mark in normal
video. If the 'sg' variable is set to a positive value, Zedit will
compensate for the blank characters, however, this feature turns off the
standout mode for the Mark.

If the 'kb', 'kl', 'kd', 'ku', and 'kh' entries are defined, Zedit
assumes they are the cursor right, left, up, done, and start of line
respectively. It also recognizes 'k0' through 'k9' if set. Zedit will
also use all the key definitions in the file. Use the Display Bindings
command to find the default bindings for these keys.


.sh 2 "Terminfo"

This section will describe what Zedit requires from terminfo. It is
assumed the user nows what terminfo is and how to configure it. A
description of the terminfo database is in the Unix manual.

To correctly display the text on the screen, Zedit needs some of the
terminfo display variables. Zedit will not run if the terminfo entry
cannot be found for your specified TERM variable. It also requires, at a
minimum, the clear_screen, clr_eol, and cursor_address variables. With
these basic strings Zedit will operate. There are, however, some other
variables which may need to be set for correct operation.

The first important optional variables are columns and lines. If they
are non-existent, Zedit will default to 80 columns and 24 lines. Zedit
also has a maximum of 132 columns and 40 lines.

Zedit will send init_1string thru init_3string if found at startup. It
sends the reset_1string at exit.

If reverse is defined, Zedit will display the mode line in reverse
video, compensating for magic_cookie_glitch if necessary. If
magic_cookie_glitch is not set and reverse is, Zedit will display the
mark in reverse video. If bold is set and magic_cookie_glitch is not,
Zedit will display the line continuation character (>) and control
characters in bold.

Zedit will also use all the key definitions in the file. Use the Display
Bindings command to find the default bindings for these keys.


.sh 2 "ANSI"

The ANSI version supports an ANSI terminal, which is basically a vt100.
It is currently not supported....
