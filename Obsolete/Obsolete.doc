:Life

Plays the game of life. It converts all the characters in the current
buffer to '*'s, then waits for a command. A Newline causes it to start
running. An Abort command causes it to stop. Any other key causes it to
step. The game of life has three laws:
.(b I
1. Law of Survival
	A * with either 2 or 3 neighbors survives.
2. Law of Death
	A * with more than 3 neighbors dies of overcrowding.
	A * with less than 2 neighbors dies of loneliness.
3. Law of Birth
	A space with exactly 3 neighbors causes birth.
