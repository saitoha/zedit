:count

Count the number of lines, words, and characters in the region. A
Universal Argument counts the entire buffer.
.sp 0
:cwd

This command allows you to change Zedit's current working directory. All
files will be relative to the new working directory. The default is the
directory the editor was started in. A Universal Argument causes the
command to repeat.
.sp 0
:delete-buffer

Deletes the current buffer and goes to a previous buffer. There must
always be at least one buffer. If the buffer has been modified, Zedit
asks to save it before deleting it. A Universal Argument prompts for the
buffer to delete.
.sp 0
:display-bindings

Inserts a list of the commands and their current bindings into the .list
buffer. It deletes the contents of the .list buffer. Keys bound to NULL
or Insert are not displayed. The PAW column displays if the command is allowed in the PAW.

A Universal Argument prompts for an output file to put the list in.
.sp 0
:exit

Exits from the editor. It asks to save all modified buffers. A bang
(!) saves all remaining buffers. A Universal Argument causes all
modified buffers to be saved without prompting.
.sp 0
:find-tag

Prompts for a string argument, with the current buffer word as the
default. It looks through a tagfile and if the tag is found, a bookmark
is set at the current Point, a Find File is performed on the matched
file name, and the Point is positioned appropriately. If the tag is not
found but a substring match is, the command will reprompt for the tag
with the first substring match as the default. To see the next substring
match use the Again command. The tag file is the file defined in the
variable "Tagfile", or the file "tags" in the current directory.
Universal Arguments are ignored.
.sp 0
:grep

Prompts for the completion of a grep command and then performs the
grep command in the *grep* buffer.
.sp 0
:hex-output

Displays the character at the Point as a hexadecimal number in the PAW.
A Universal Argument displays the next characters up to a
maximum of 25. The Point is moved forward by the argument characters.
.sp 0
:indent

Indents the marked region Universal Argument tab stops.
.sp 0
:insert-overwrite

overwrite modes. On the PC the cursor shape reflects the mode. Insert
mode has an underline cursor while overwrite mode has a block cursor. A
Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0
:key-binding

Prompts for a key and displays the current command bound to the key in the
PAW. Handles C-X and M- prefixes. A Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0

it can continue. Unix only.

Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0
:make

This command performs the command specified in the Make variable and
puts the output in the ".make" buffer. The command is usually "make" and
is used in conjunction with the Next Error command. A Universal Argument
prompts for the command to execute.
.sp 0
:mark-paragraph

Sets the Mark to the start of the current paragraph and moves the Point
to the start of the next paragraph. A Universal Argument causes the

:mode

for the mode to change to.  A Universal Argument causes multiple
toggles.
.sp 0
:next-buffer

Switches to the next buffer in the buffer list. At the end of the list,
it switches to the first buffer in the list, i.e. treats the list like a
ring. A Universal Argument causes the command to repeat.
.sp 0
:next-error

Used after a Make command to search for error messages in the ".make"
buffer. If an error is found, the Mark in the ".make" buffer is placed
at the start of the error message. The file containing the error is
loaded into a buffer using the Find File command and the Point is placed
at the error line.

If a Universal Argument is specified, Next Error tries to ignore warnings.
.sp 0
:quote

The Quote command is used to insert a character into a buffer or String
Argument that would normally be a command. The next character after the
Quote command is taken literally, unless the key is a valid hexadecimal
digit. If the key is a valid hexadecimal digit, it and the next key are
taken together as a hexadecimal number and the ASCII character
equivalent of this number is inserted into the buffer. If a key is not
hit within approximately one second, "Quote:" is displayed in the echo
window. The Quote command does not work within a Universal Argument. A
Universal Argument inserts Arg characters.
.sp 0
:reference

Prompts for a tag and then runs the 'ref' command on it. See the
documentation for `elvis'.
.sp 0
:save-bindings

of the edit session. The Save Bindings command is used to permanently
save any new bindings in the bindings file. A Universal Argument
causes Arg saves!
.sp 0
:set-variable

File.
.sp 0
:spell

This command is an interactive interface to the "ispell" program. It
allows you to perform spell checking on the current buffer. A Universal
Argument limits the spell check to the Region. The default is to check
the entire buffer.
.sp 0
:switch-to-buffer

Prompts for a buffer name to switch to with command completion.
The previous buffer is stored and displayed as a default. This allows

:universal-argument

Many of the commands accept a Universal Argument to cause the command to
repeat or to modify the meaning of the command in some way. It reads
decimal digits and displays them in the PAW. The first non-digit is
processed as a command. The digits cannot be deleted since Delete is a
valid command that accepts a Universal Argument. If a mistake is made,
use the Abort Command.

Turns off the modified flag for the current buffer. Does not change the
buffer itself. A Universal Argument is ignored.
