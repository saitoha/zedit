:count

Count the number of lines, words, and characters in the region. A
Universal Argument counts the entire buffer.
.sp 0
:cwd

This command allows you to change Zedit's current working directory. All
files will be relative to the new working directory. The default is the
directory the editor was started in. A Universal Argument causes the
command to repeat.
.sp 0
:delete-buffer

Deletes the current buffer and goes to a previous buffer. There must
always be at least one buffer. If the buffer has been modified, Zedit
asks to save it before deleting it. A Universal Argument prompts for the
buffer to delete.
.sp 0
:delete-window

Deletes the current window and places you in the other window. You
cannot delete the last window. A Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0
:display-bindings

Inserts a list of the commands and their current bindings into the .list
buffer. It deletes the contents of the .list buffer. Keys bound to NULL
or Insert are not displayed. The PAW column displays if the command is allowed in the PAW.

A Universal Argument prompts for an output file to put the list in.
.sp 0
:exit

Exits from the editor. It asks to save all modified buffers. A bang
(!) saves all remaining buffers. A Universal Argument causes all
modified buffers to be saved without prompting.
.sp 0
:fill-check

Checks if the current column is past the FillWidth column. If it is, the
words past or on the FillWidth column are wrapped. This gives some word
processing capability to the editor. Normally bound to the space bar and
Newline only in Text Mode. A Universal Argument has no meaning.
.sp 0
:fill-paragraph

Uses the FillWidth to reformat the paragraph the Point is in. This is
useful if editing has messed up the right margin. A Universal Argument
reformats the next Arg paragraphs. A Universal Argument of 0 reformats
the entire buffer. When reformatting the entire buffer, hitting a
character will abort the reformat. Not allowed in program mode buffers.
.sp 0
:find-file

Prompts for a path name. If a buffer already exists with this path name,
that buffer is switched to. If no buffer is matched, a new buffer is
created and the file read into it. Supports file name completion. A
Universal Argument causes the command to repeat.
.sp 0
:find-tag

Prompts for a string argument, with the current buffer word as the
default. It looks through a tagfile and if the tag is found, a bookmark
is set at the current Point, a Find File is performed on the matched
file name, and the Point is positioned appropriately. If the tag is not
found but a substring match is, the command will reprompt for the tag
with the first substring match as the default. To see the next substring
match use the Again command. The tag file is the file defined in the
variable "Tagfile", or the file "tags" in the current directory.
Universal Arguments are ignored.
.sp 0
:global-re-search

This command is used to search for a regular expression in all the buffers.
It prompts for a search string and then starts searching at the start of
the first buffer. If a match is found, it stops and leaves the point at
the match. If Again is executed, it starts at the current Point and
searches forwards through the buffers. At the last buffer it stops and
puts the Point back where it started. A Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0
:global-search

This command is used to search for a string in all the buffers. It
prompts for a search string and then starts searching at the start of
the first buffer. If a match is found, it stops and leaves the point at
the match. If Again is executed, it starts at the current Point and
searches forwards through the buffers. At the last buffer it stops and
puts the Point back where it started. A Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0
:grep

Prompts for the completion of a grep command and then performs the
grep command in the *grep* buffer.
.sp 0
:grow-window

Makes the active window one line bigger, and therefore the inactive
window one line smaller. A window cannot be less than three (3) lines.
If there is only one window, this command has no effect. A Universal
Argument causes the command to grow the window by that number of lines.

A Universal Argument displays the next characters up to a
maximum of 25. The Point is moved forward by the argument characters.
.sp 0
:incremental-search

Searches for the string after every character is entered in the PAW. The
Delete Previous Character command can be used to delete a character and
"back up" the search. The Newline character terminates the search. The
Abort command terminates the search and places the Point back where it
was. Any other commands terminates the search and performs that command.
A Universal Argument causes the command to repeat.
.sp 0
:indent

Indents the marked region Universal Argument tab stops.
.sp 0
:insert-character

Normally bound to the printable characters, causes the character to be
inserted in the buffer. A Universal Argument causes the command to
repeat.

it switches to the first buffer in the list, i.e. treats the list like a
ring. A Universal Argument causes the command to repeat.
.sp 0
:next-error

Used after a Make command to search for error messages in the ".make"
buffer. If an error is found, the Mark in the ".make" buffer is placed
at the start of the error message. The file containing the error is
loaded into a buffer using the Find File command and the Point is placed
at the error line.

If a Universal Argument is specified, Next Error tries to ignore warnings.
.sp 0
:next-paragraph

Moves the Point to the start of the next paragraph. A Universal Argument
causes the command to repeat.

circular list. A Universal Argument goes to the Nth previous window.
.sp 0
:query-replace

Prompts for a search string and a replacement string and searches from the
current Point looking for matches of the search string. If it finds a
match, it moves the Point to the match and waits for one of the
following input characters:
.(l
,              Replace current match and confirm.
space          Replace current match and continue.
y              Replace current match and continue.
.              Replace and exit.
!              Global replace.
^              Goto previous match.
Abort          Exit without replacing current match.
Others         Continue without replacing current match.
.)l
The Point is left at the position it was in before the Query Replace. If
the mode Exact is set, the search will be case sensitive. A Universal
Argument causes the replacement to be done globally in all the buffers.
.sp 0
:quote

The Quote command is used to insert a character into a buffer or String
Argument that would normally be a command. The next character after the
Quote command is taken literally, unless the key is a valid hexadecimal
digit. If the key is a valid hexadecimal digit, it and the next key are
taken together as a hexadecimal number and the ASCII character
equivalent of this number is inserted into the buffer. If a key is not
hit within approximately one second, "Quote:" is displayed in the echo
window. The Quote command does not work within a Universal Argument. A
Universal Argument inserts Arg characters.
.sp 0
:re-replace

Works like the Query Replace command except that the search string is a
regular expression. The replacement string is a literal with two
exceptions. An '&' character causes the matched string to be placed in
the buffer. The escape character '\' can be used to turn off this
special meaning of '&'. Note that "\\" is required to put a real "\" in
the buffer. For each match, a prompt is made for the action to perform.
See Query Replace for a list of valid actions. A Universal
Argument causes the replacement to be done globally in all the buffers.
.sp 0
:re-search

Asks for a regular expression search string and searches from the Point
forward for a match in the buffer. If a match is found, the Point is
moved to the start of the match. If the string is not found, then "Not
Found" is displayed in the echo window and the Point is left where it
was. The search string is saved and subsequent search and replace
commands will default to this string. If the mode Exact is set, the
search will be case sensitive. A Universal Argument causes the search
to look for exactly Arg matches of the string.
.sp 0
:read-file

Prompts for a path name, with file name completion,  and inserts the
file into the current buffer before the Point. If there is a Universal
Argument, the current buffer is deleted, first asking to save the file
if it is modified, before reading in the new file. The buffers file name
is not changed, any writes will be to the old file name.
.sp 0
:reference

Prompts for a tag and then runs the 'ref' command on it. See the
documentation for `elvis'.
.sp 0
:replace

Prompts for a search string and a replacement string and searches from
the current Point looking for matches of the search string. If it finds
a match, it replaces the string and continues. The Point is left at the
position it was in before the Query Replace. If the mode Exact is set,
the search will be case sensitive. A Universal Argument causes the
replacement to be done globally in all the buffers.
.sp 0
:reverse-inc-search

Searches backwards for the string after every character is entered in
the PAW. The Delete Previous Character command can be used to delete a
character and "forward up" (???) the search. The Newline character
terminates the search. The Abort command terminates the search and
places the Point back where it was. Any other command terminates the
search and performs the command. A Universal Argument causes the command
to repeat.
.sp 0
:reverse-search

Prompts for a search string and searches from the Point backward for a
match in the buffer. If a match is found, the Point is moved to the
start of the match. If the string is not found, then "Not Found" is
displayed in the echo window and the Point is not moved. The search
string is saved and subsequent search and replace commands will default
to the last search string. If the mode Exact is set, the search will be
case sensitive. A Universal Argument causes the search to look for
exactly Arg matches of the String Argument.
.sp 0
:revert-file

Rereads the current file. If the file has changed, asks to overwrite
changes. A Universal Argument causes multiple rereads. Mimics the vi "e"
command.
.sp 0
:save-all-files

Saves all modified buffers. A Universal Argument causes ALL files to be
saved, modified or not.
.sp 0
:save-bindings

A key bound with the Bind command only stays in effect for the duration
of the edit session. The Save Bindings command is used to permanently
save any new bindings in the bindings file. A Universal Argument
causes Arg saves!
.sp 0
:save-file

Saves the current buffer to its file. If the current buffer has no path
name, a path name is prompted for (with file name completion). A
Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0
:search

Prompts for a search string and searches from the Point forward for a
match in the buffer. If a match is found, the Point is moved to the
start of the match. If the string is not found, then "Not Found" is
displayed in the echo window and the Point is not moved. The search
string is saved and subsequent search or replace commands will default
to the last search string. If the mode Exact is set, the search will be
case sensitive. A Universal Argument causes the search to look for
exactly Arg matches.
.sp 0
:set-mark

Sets the Mark at the Point. A Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0
:set-variable

Allows any of the configurable variables to be set. Command completion
is supported. Prompts for the variable, then prompts for the new
setting. A Universal Argument causes numeric or flag variables to be
set to Arg, string variables ignore the Universal Argument.
.sp 0
:setenv

Performs a 'setenv' command on an environment variable. The variable will
keep the setting during the the Zedit session.
.sp 0
:show-config

Show the current settings of all the Zedit variables in a buffer. The buffer
is suitable for use as a .config.z file and can be saved to a file using Write
File.
.sp 0
:shrink-window

Shrinks the current window one line. A Universal Argument shrinks the
window Arg lines.
.sp 0
:size-window

Sets the window to Universal Argument lines.
.sp 0
:spell

This command is an interactive interface to the "ispell" program. It
allows you to perform spell checking on the current buffer. A Universal
Argument limits the spell check to the Region. The default is to check
the entire buffer.
.sp 0
:switch-to-buffer

Prompts for a buffer name to switch to with command completion.
The previous buffer is stored and displayed as a default. This allows
quick switching between two buffers. The Again command can be used to
scroll through the buffer list. A Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0
:tab

Handles the tab key. A Universal Argument causes the command to repeat.
.sp 0
:toggle-case

Switches the current buffers minor mode between case sensitive and case
insensitive for searches and replacements. Ignores the Universal
Argument.
.sp 0
:trim-white-space

Removes all spaces and tabs on both sides of the Point. The Point is
left on the character that is to the right of the deleted text. The
deleted characters are not put in the Kill Buffer. A Universal Argument
is ignored.
.sp 0
:two-windows

Splits the current window into two windows. The same buffer is displayed in
both windows and the bottom window is made active. A Universal Argument
keeps splitting the current window.

:undent

Removes Universal Argument tabs from the start of every line in the
region.
.sp 0
:undo

Undo the previous edit. There is a list of undos.
.sp 0
:universal-argument

Many of the commands accept a Universal Argument to cause the command to
repeat or to modify the meaning of the command in some way. It reads
decimal digits and displays them in the PAW. The first non-digit is
processed as a command. The digits cannot be deleted since Delete is a
valid command that accepts a Universal Argument. If a mistake is made,
use the Abort Command.
.sp 0
:unmodify

Turns off the modified flag for the current buffer. Does not change the
buffer itself. A Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0
:uppercase-region

Convert the Region to uppercase. Not allowed in program mode buffers. A
Universal Argument is ignored.
.sp 0
:write-file

Prompts for a path name and writes out the current buffer to this file
name. Supports file name completion. It changes the path name of the
current buffer to the new path name. A Universal Argument causes only
the Region to be written and does not change the name of the buffer.
.sp 0
