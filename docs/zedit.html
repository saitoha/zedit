<h1>Introduction</h1>


<h2>What is Zedit?</h2>

<p>Zedit is a fully configurable text editor. It supports multiple windows
and multiple buffers. There is a virtual buffering scheme for machines
with limited memory. It is available for Unix machines and PCs.

<p>Editing commands are "bound" (assigned) to key sequences. These
sequences can be control key, function key, PC ALT key, or keypad key
combinations. A set of default bindings comes with the editor, but all
key bindings can be modified. This allows you to set up the editor the
way you want it.

<p>To allow further customization of Zedit, there are user variables that
allow you to change the workings of Zedit. For example, there is a
variable called "Tabs" that controls the tab columns.

<p>Zedit can also have disk caching to speed up disk access. On PCs, Zedit
will utilize extended or expanded memory.

<p>One of the most powerful features of the editor is tag files. A tag file
allows you to find files by "tag" name instead of file name. For
example, you might create a tag file of all the functions in a given
executable program and reference the files by function name instead of
having to know which file a function is in. See the "Tags" section for a
description of tag files.


<h2>Some Basic Terms</h2>

<p>A few terms need to be defined.

<p>A buffer is a collection of characters that can be manipulated with the
editor. A buffer is usually, but does not have to be, associated with a
file. A buffer called "Main" is always created on startup. The number of
buffers is only limited by available memory.

<p>A buffer can be much larger than the size of a computer screen. A window
is the portion of the buffer that is displayed on the screen. By moving
the window over the buffer, the entire buffer can be edited.

<p>Mulitple windows can be displayed on the screen at the same time. The
windows can display different buffers, or different sections of the same
buffer. Only one window is active at any one time. The active window has
the cursor in it.

<p>If a buffer line is greater than the width of the screen, Zedit will
continue the buffer line on the next screen line. The '>' character will
be displayed in the last column of the screen line to show the line has
wrapped. This character is not put in the buffer.

<p>The Point is the current location in the buffer. Every buffer has its
own Point. Most work on the buffer is done relative to the Point. The
Point is represented in the active window by the cursor.

<p>Every buffer also has a user defined Mark, which is set with the Set
Mark command. The Mark is represented by a reverse video block on the
screen. The Mark is like a bookmark, it is used to keep track of a
specific place in a buffer. The Mark is most often used with commands
that deal with the Region.

<p>The Point and Mark are actually before the character they are displayed
on but after the previous character.

<p>The Region is all the characters in the buffer bounded by the Mark and
the Point. The Region can be before or after the Point. The Region is
used to work with blocks of text.


<h2>Invocation</h2>

<p>The easiest method of starting Zedit is to type "z" at the prompt. This
will start Zedit and put you in a buffer called Main. If you want to
edit a specific file, "z filename" will start Zedit and load the file
into a buffer. More than one file can be specified, and wildcards are
supported. If more than one file is specified, Zedit will load all the
files into different buffers and make the first file specified the
active buffer.

<p>When a file is loaded into the buffer, the Point and Mark are set to the
beginning of the file. If the option "-l<line>" is specified, the Point
will be placed at the start of the given line or at the end of the
buffer is the line is not in the file. This only affects the buffer that
is made active at startup.

<p>If the variable DoSave is set, Zedit will create a save file at exit. If
Zedit is then started with no arguments it will read this file and
return Zedit to the state it was in when you exited. This is extremely
useful for edit/compile/run cycles. See the "Save" section for more
information. A simple way to start the editor without reading the save
file is to type "z -".

<p>The full Zedit command line is:
z [-l#] [-b] [-u] [-p#] [-s#] [file ...]

<p>On PCs, a "-b" option can be given to read files as binary files. All
file after the  "-b"  on the command line are opened in binary mode.
This allows the editing of executable files. A 'B' is shown on the mode
line for binary files. For more information on the "-b" option, see the
appendix for PCs.

<p>On PCs, the "-u" command can be used to change the meaning of some of
the key bindings from a "Unix" to "PC" standard. See the section on the
Meta key.

<p>The last two options, "-s" and "-p", are to allow the customization of
the low level virtual buffering scheme. They are described in detail in
the "Technical" section.


<h2>The Status Line</h2>

<p>Each user window has a status line at the bottom. The status line is in
reverse video if supported by the terminal. The status line describes
the current status of the buffer in that window. A typical status line
is shown below:

.ce
Zedit 3.0  (Text)  zedit.doc: /home/zedit/doc/zedit.doc *+

<p>"Zedit 3.0" is the version of Zedit. "(Text)" is the current buffer
mode. After the mode comes the buffer name. Every buffer must have a
unique buffer name of up to 15 characters. The main use of the buffer
name is for the Switch to Buffer command.

<p>After the buffer name comes the file name. A buffer does not have to
have a file name. This name is usually the name of the file read into
the buffer at startup or with the Find File command. If the file name is
too large to fit on the status line, it will be left truncated.

<p>The last group of characters are flags used to specify buffer status.
The asterisk (*) means that the buffer has been modified. The Exit
command, for example, uses this flag to decide whether to ask to save a
buffer. The plus sign (+) is the delete flag. See the "Kill Ring"
section for more detail on the delete flag and its use.

<p>The 'F' flag, means that this is a Fastread buffer. The 'B' signifies a
Binary buffer. See the "Technical" section for more detail.

<p>The current line and column can also be displayed in the status line by
setting the Lines variable. Lines displays the current line and column
the Point is at in the format "line:column". This is displayed at the
extreme right of the status line.


<h3>Major Modes</h3>

<p>Every buffer has one major mode and possibly one or two minor
modes. The major modes affect operations in the buffer and are mutually
exclusive. The major modes are: Normal, C, Text, and View. Normal is the
regular editing mode for the editor. Other modes are used to change the
normal operation of the editor.


<h4>C Mode</h4>

<p>In C mode, the Newline command (usually the Enter or Return key on the
keyboard) is bound to the C Indent command. This causes Newline to
auto-indent to the current tab level. If a Newline is hit after an open
brace ({), the next line is indented an extra tab stop. The close brace
(}) is bound to C Insert. This causes the close brace to line up with
the first unmatched open brace. C mode is automatically set if a file
ends in ".c", ".h", or ."y".

<p>C Mode also has optional "matching" capabilities. The matching is
controlled by the Match variable. If Match is 0, no matching occurs.

<p>If Match is 1, Zedit will "match" all ')' and ']' with there matching
'(' or '[' by moving the cursor to the matching character temporarily.
If there is no match, Zedit will beep.

<p>If Match is 2, Zedit will insert a ')' or ']' for every '(' or '['
typed.


<h4>Text Mode</h4>

<p>Text mode has word processing type features. In Text mode, the space bar
and Newline are bound to the Fill Check command. The Fill Check command
is used to wrap words that go past the FillWidth column and to indent to
a fixed right margin. The left margin is defined by the Margin variable.
The left margin does not affect the first line in the paragraph.

<p>The Fill Paragraph command can be used to clean up a paragraph. It uses
both the Margin and FillWidth variables to format the current paragraph.
A Universal Argument of zero (0) causes the command to reformat the
entire buffer. If a key is hit during a global reformat, the reformat
will abort at the end of the paragraph it is currently formatting.

<p>Text mode is turned on with the Toggle Fill Mode command or can be the
default if the variable Normal is turned off. It also gets turned on by
file names ending in ".doc".


<h4>View Mode</h4>

<p>View mode is automatically set for read only files. In View mode,
commands that modify the buffer are not allowed. The Newline character
is changed to perform a Next Line command. Commands available in a View
buffer are marked by an 'r' in the perms column of Appendix A and the
output from the Display Bindings command.


<h3>Minor Modes</h3>

<p>Along with the major modes, the editor has two minor modes, overwrite
and Exact. All or none of the minor modes can be active in a given
buffer.


<h4>Overwrite Mode</h4>

 The editor is usually in insert mode. This means characters are
inserted at the Point, moving all the characters after the Point over
one character. The Point is left on the character it was originally on.
In overwrite mode, characters are placed over top of the character the
Point is on and the Point is moved forward one space. Overwrite mode is
set with the Insert/Overwrite command. On PCs, insert mode is signified
by a blinking underline cursor, and overwrite by a blinking block
cursor. On Unix systems, the word "Ovwrt" is displayed in the status
line after the major mode. The status line in the above example was in
insert mode, in overwrite mode it would display:

.ce
Zedit 3.0  (Text Ovwrt)  zedit.doc: /home/zedit/doc/zedit.doc *+


<h4>Exact Mode</h4>

<p>Exact specifies whether search/replace functions are to be case
sensitive. Searches are case sensitive by default. A search for the
string "string" will not match "String" or "STRING". If Exact is off,
then "string" will match "String", "STRING", "string", or "sTrInG". Case
insensitivity is set with the Toggle Case command. In Exact mode,
prompts that are case insensitive are displayed in uppercase. For
example, the prompt for a search string is usually "Search". If Exact is
off, it would be "SEARCH:".


<h2>Kill Buffer</h2>

<p>The kill buffer is a special buffer created by Zedit to store deleted or
copied text. This buffer does not show up in the buffer list and is
never saved.

<p>When text is deleted, it is placed in the kill buffer. If the delete
flag is set (a '+' in the status line), the text will be appended to the
kill buffer. If the delete flag is not set, the kill buffer will be
overwritten.

<p>The Yank command will yank the text from the kill buffer.


<h2>String Arguments and the PAW</h2>

<p>Various command require string arguments. For example, the Forward
Search command needs the string to search for. String arguments are
entered in the Prompt Argument Window (PAW). The PAW is a special one
line buffer that is on the last line of the display. The PAW is
restricted to this one line and will truncate past the end of this line.
The PAW is also used to display error and informational messages.

<p>Most of the editor commands are available in the PAW. Commands that
leave the current buffer or window, for example Switch to Buffer, or
commands that need the PAW, for example Print Position, cannot be
executed in the PAW. The commands available in the PAW are marked with a
"p" in the perms column of appendix A and the output of the Display
Bindings command. Note that the Again command is marked as usable in the
PAW. This is only true for the Find Tag command for partial matches. See
section "tags" for more detail.

<p>String arguments may have optional defaults. For example, the Forward
Search command defaults to the last search string. When a string
argument has a default, the default is displayed in the PAW and the
Point is placed at the start of the default. If the Newline command is
executed, the default will be used. If a key bound to the Insert
Character, most ASCII characters not bound to a command, or the Get
Buffer Word commands is the first character entered in the PAW, the
default is deleted and the character, or word, entered. If any other
command is entered, the default is left in place and the command acts on
it.

<p>Three special cases of string arguments are Command Completion, "ask"
(yes/no) type prompts, and Incremental Search prompts. Command
Completion is explained in section 1.9.

<p>Yes/no "ask" type prompts usually end in a question mark (?) and expect a
yes/no response. Valid inputs to an "ask" prompt are Y, y, N, n, or the
Abort command. A bell will sound if an invalid key is hit. An example of
an "ask" type prompt is the question "Save buffer Main?" during the Exit
command.

<p>The Abort command always exits a prompt of any type except after a Quote
command.


<h2>Universal Argument</h2>

<p>Most commands in Zedit will respond to a Universal Argument. The
Universal Argument is a number that is entered in the PAW. Any non-digit
stops the Universal Argument and is executed as a command.

<p>Usually, a Universal Argument tells a command to execute more than once.
However, sometimes it is used to toggle the way a command works. The
help and command descriptions explain what the Universal Argument does
for each command.


<h2>Meta, C-X, and M-X</h2>

<p>Commands in Zedit are usually bound to control keys, however, there are
not enough control keys on a keyboard. To solve this problem, Zedit
employs prefix commands. A prefix command waits for another keystroke
and modifies the meaning of that keystroke. This allows a much wider set
of commands.

<p>For example, C-F goes forward one character, M-F goes forward one word.
The Meta key is the Esc key. To execute M-F you would type Esc and then
F.

<p>On the PC, the Meta key is also the ALT key and should be used like the
Ctrl key. If the "-u" option is specified, the Esc key is bound to the
Abort command and the ALT key must be used as the Meta key. This is to
conform to the PC usage of Esc as an "Escape" key.

<p>The Extended Command, also known as the Meta X (M-X) command, allows any
Zedit command to be executed, even if it is not bound to a key. When the
Extended Command is executed, it prompts with "M-X:" and waits for a
command name. Hitting the Abort command will cancel the Extended
Command. A list of the valid commands is included in appendix A. When a
valid command is entered, it is executed normally. Any Universal
Argument is passed directly to the entered command.

<p>The Extended Command supports command completion. As you type characters
at the prompt, the editor tries to complete the command you are typing.
If the text matches a command uniquely, the editor will display the
complete command. If the current word is unique, the complete word will
be displayed with a space after it. The editor will not allow you to hit
return if the command in the PAW is not unique.

<p>If the variable ExecOnMatch is set, command completion will execute the
command as soon as the command is uniquely matched.

<p>An example of command completion is given for the Find Tag
command.

<p><table>
<tr><th>User<th>Displayed<th>Commentary
<tr><td>"f"<td>"Fi"<td>Non-unique: matches Find File, Find Tag, or Fill Paragraph.
<tr><td>"n"<td>"Find "<td>Now matches a unique word: completes word.
<tr><td>"t"<td>"Find Tag"<td>Now matches a unique command. Hit Enter
to execute or C-G to abort.
</table>

<p>In the above example only 3 characters had to be typed to complete a 8
character command. Full editing capabilities are still available during
command completion.

<p>Other commands also support command completion, for example: Bind, Set
Variable, and Switch Buffer.


<h1>Configuration Files</h1>

<p>Zedit has three configuration files: bindings, config, and help.
All of these files are optional, however, help commands are unavailable
without the help file. These files are used to customize the editor.

<p>The file names for the configuration files are in the appendix for your
specific machines.


<h2>Bindings File</h2>

<p>The bindings file is used to store user key bindings. Zedit comes with
a default set of key bindings built in, it does not need a bindings
file. This file is created with the Save Bindings command. It first
tries to save the file in the directory pointed to by the HOME
environment variable. If HOME is not set, it saves the file in the
current directory. At startup, Zedit tries to load the bindings file
from the directory that the Zedit executable is in, then in the
directory pointed to by the HOME environment variable, then in the
current directory. Each file found overwrites the previous.

<p>The bindings file is a binary memory image.


<h2>Configuration File</h2>

<p>The config file is used to save the configuration variables which allow
customization of the editor. These variables are given defaults by
Zedit, can be assigned values in the config file, or can be modified
at run time. Since they are given built in defaults, the config file
is optional.

<p>The format for specifying a variable in the config file is:
&lt;variable_name&gt; &lt;variable&gt;

<p>The variable_name is one of the variables name shown in appendix B.
Only the first three (3) characters of the name are needed. The space
can be any number of spaces and/or tabs as long as there is at least one
space or tab. The variable is a number for DECIMAL or FLAG variables and
a string for STRING variables. STRING variables can contain spaces. Each
variable must be on a separate line. The variables are case insensitive.

<p>Zedit looks for the config first in the directory that the Zedit
executable was in, then the directory pointed to by the environment
variable HOME, then the current directory. All files found are loaded,
with later files taking precedence.


<h2>Help File</h2>

<p>The help file contains the text for Zedits on-line help command. This
file must exist for these commands to work.

<p>While a help file is supplied with the editor, you might want to
customize it. The help file MUST be in alphabetical order by command
name. The command name MUST start with a ':'s. Note that if you
change the help file, it may not work with later versions of the
editor.
