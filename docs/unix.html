<h1>Appendix C: Unix Version</h1>

<h2>Files</h2>
<p>Files are an important part of any editor, therefore, Zedit tries to
make file name entry as easy as possible. The Zedit file commands all
support file name completion. If you are typing in a file name and hit
&lt;tab&gt;, Zedit will try to complete the file name much like
Command Completion. A &lt;space&gt; will display all possible matches.
<p>Zedit also understands:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>.<td>The current directory.
<tr><td>..<td>The previous directory.
<tr><td>~<td>Your home directory.
<tr><td>~&lt;loginname&gt;<td>The home directory for loginname.
</table>
<p>Zedit limits a full path name to 128 characters.
<p>For backups, Zedit appends a ~ to the filename. On SYS5 machines, it
will place the ~ at the 14th character.

<h2>Shell Commands</h2>
<p>Zedit supports piped shells and makes on Unix machines. This allows you
to have a shell running at the same time as you are editing. It also
allows a make and editing at the same time or makes without leaving the
editor. It also allows you to perform Next Error commands while the make
is still in progress.

<h2>Terminal Interfaces</h2>
<p>Zedit supports two standard Unix terminal interface definitions:
terminfo, and ANSI.

<p>Terminfo is a second standard terminal database (after termcaps) that
is compiled for faster database access. It also supports a wider range
of keys and terminal characteristics.
<p>The ANSI terminal interface emulates a basic vt100.

<h3>Terminfo</h3>

<p>This section will describe what Zedit requires from terminfo. It is
assumed the user knows what terminfo is and how to configure it. A
description of the terminfo database is in the Unix manual.
<p>To correctly display the text on the screen, Zedit needs some of the
terminfo display variables. Zedit will not run if the terminfo entry
cannot be found for your specified TERM variable. It also requires, at a
minimum, the clear_screen, clr_eol, and cursor_address variables. With
these basic strings Zedit will operate. There are, however, some other
variables which may need to be set for correct operation.
<p>The first important optional variables are columns and lines. If they
are non-existent, Zedit will default to 80 columns and 24 lines. Zedit
also has a maximum of 132 columns and 40 lines.
<p>Zedit will send init_1string thru init_3string if found at startup. It
sends the reset_1string at exit.
<p>If reverse is defined, Zedit will display the mode line in reverse
video, compensating for magic_cookie_glitch if necessary. If
magic_cookie_glitch is not set and reverse is, Zedit will display the
mark in reverse video. If bold is set and magic_cookie_glitch is not,
Zedit will display the line continuation character (>) and control
characters in bold.
<p>Zedit will also use all the key definitions in the file. Use the Display
Bindings command to find the default bindings for these keys.

<h3>ANSI</h3>
<p>The ANSI version supports an ANSI terminal, which is basically a
vt100. No external files are required for ANSI. ANSI supports all
Zedit screen features. This is the default.
