<h1>Appendix C: Unix Version</h1>

<h2>Files</h2>
<p>Files are an important part of any editor, therefore, Zedit tries to
make file name entry as easy as possible. The Zedit file commands all
support file name completion. If you are typing in a file name and hit
&lt;tab&gt;, Zedit will try to complete the file name much like
Command Completion. A &lt;space&gt; will display all possible matches.
<p>Zedit also understands:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>.<td>The current directory.
<tr><td>..<td>The previous directory.
<tr><td>~<td>Your home directory.
<tr><td>~&lt;loginname&gt;<td>The home directory for loginname.
</table>
<p>Zedit limits a full path name to 128 characters.
<p>For backups, Zedit appends a ~ to the filename. On SYS5 machines, it
will place the ~ at the 14th character.

<h2>Shell Commands</h2>
<p>Zedit supports piped shells and makes on Unix machines. This allows you
to have a shell running at the same time as you are editing. It also
allows a make and editing at the same time or makes without leaving the
editor. It also allows you to perform Next Error commands while the make
is still in progress.

<h2>Keys</h2>

<p>Zedit does not support as many keys as emacs. Aside from the normal
control keys and meta key, Zedit supports the following keys:

    <ul>
      <li>Function keys F1 to F12 inclusive
      <li>The arrow keys
      <li>The navigation keys: Page Up/Down, Home/End, Insert/Delete
      <li>The Ctrl arrow keys
      <li>Ctrl Home and Ctrl End
    </ul>

<p>Note: For termcap and terminfo only keys that have entries in the database
are supported. ANSI supports all keys

<p>Hint: For termcap and terminfo it helps if all the special keys
start with the ESCAPE character. Zedit can then optimize key lookup.
