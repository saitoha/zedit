.sh 1 "Files" 1

Files are an important part of any editor, therefore, Zedit tries to
make file name entry as easy as possible. The Zedit file commands all
support file name completion. If you are typing in a file name and hit
the <tab>, Zedit will try to complete the file name much like
Command Completion. A <space> will display all possible matches.

Zedit supports full DOS wildcards at startup. It also allows full DOS
filenames of the form:
.ce
	<drive>:<dir>\<dir>\<fname>

The '\' character and the `/` character can be used interchangeable,
however, Zedit will convert them to '\' characters. Zedit defaults to
the current drive and the current directory.

In file names, it accepts "." as the current directory and ".." as the
previous directory. Zedit limits a full path name to 128 characters. The
filename portion is limited to 8 characters, a dot (.), and a 3 character
extension.

For backups, Zedit appends a ~ to the filename using the following
table:

.(b I
Original File Name		Backup File Name
------------------		----------------
file				file.~
file.e				file.e~
file.ext			file.ex~
.)b


.sh 2 "PC File I/O and the Binary Flag"

In the PC world, normal ASCII text files contain lines terminated by LF
CR characters. However, many programs (including Zedit), expect lines to
end in a single LF. To overcome this problem, the PC has two file modes;
text and binary. In text mode, when reading a file, the LF CR pair is
converted to a single LF. Text mode also stops reading when it gets a
C-Z character in the input file. Binary mode performs no conversion.
Zedit normally opens files in text mode. If you need to edit a binary
file, or a text file that contains C-Zs, the binary option is needed.

To preserve binary files, the Addnl feature is turned off in buffers
which have Binary mode set.

Binary mode is specified at startup with the -b flag. All files
specified after the -b will be started in binary. A binary buffer is
displayed with a 'B' in the status line after the file name. The binary
status is save in the save file.


.sh 1 "Shell Commands"

Zedit supports shell escapes to DOS. When you are finished in DOS, type
\'exit' to return to Zedit.

Other shell commands perform the command, redirecting the output to a
file. The file is then read into Zedit.

The Make command is not very useful, since it requires too much memory.
However, you can run the make outside of Zedit, redirecting the output
to a file (for example make.out). You can then enter Zedit and read the file
into the .make buffer by specify a Universal Argument and specifying:
.ce
type make.out
at the command prompt. You can then use the Next Error command.


.sh 1 "Terminal Interface"

Zedit uses memory mapped video for speed. It will compensate for CGA so
there is no "snow".

Zedit supports bolding the current line if the Boldline variable is set.
It will also put a border around the windows if Border is set.

The status line is always in reverse video, as is the mark. The
continuation character and control characters are displayed in bold if
Boldline is not set.

Zedit stores the current screen image on startup and restores it at
exit.


.sh 1 "Environment Variables"

The environment variable HOME should be set to the directory in which
you will store global files such as bindings or configuration.


.sh 1 "Mail Command"

Some PCs have a Unix style mail command. If this is true for your
machine, you should set the MAIL define in the config.h file. You should
also insure that the MAILDIR environment variable points to the
directory containing the mail files.
