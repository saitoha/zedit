<h1>Commands</h1>

<p>Almost every key on the keyboard can be bound to a
command. Commands can be one or two keystrokes long. Commands that are
prefixed with C- are control commands. It means type the Ctrl key and
the key listed after the - at the same time.

<p>The command prefix C-X means to type Ctrl and X at the same time, then
type the sequence after it. For example, C-X C-A tells you to type Ctrl
and X at the same time, then to type Ctrl and A at the same time.

<p>The prefix M- means to hit the Meta key, then the key after it. The
Meta key can be Esc, in which case you type Esc then the next key
sequence. On most keyboards Meta is also the Alt key. The Alt key
works like the Ctrl key.

<p>So M-A could be Esc then A or Alt and A at the same time. Currently
all alphabetic Meta characters are case insensitive. So M-A and M-a
are the same thing.

<h2>Point Movement</h2>

<p>Aside from text input, Point movement is the most used feature of an
editor. Zedit has commands that move the point by characters, words,
lines, paragraphs, and buffer.

<p>On most terminals, the character Point movement will be done with the
arrow keys, however, control commands are included for terminals without
such keys.

<h2>Search and Replace Commands</h2>

<p>Zedit supports a wide variety of search and replace commands. There
three basic types of searches: literal, incremental, and expression. The
literal searches are performed by the Forward Search and Reverse Search
commands. These commands prompt for a search string and look for a match
of that string in the buffer. A Universal Argument causes the literal
and expression searches to look for exactly Arg matches. If they cannot
find the correct number of matches, they display the message "Found #",
where # is the number of matches found. "Not Found" is displayed if no
matches where found.

<p>The incremental search commands (Incremental Search and Reverse Inc.
Search) are used to find a match in the least amount of key strokes. On
every normal ASCII character entered, Zedit will try to find a match for
the current string in the PAW. If a match is found, the Mark is
displayed at this Point on the screen. If the Delete Previous Character
command is executed, the previous character is deleted in the PAW and
the Mark is backed up to the last complete match.

<p>The Abort command can be executed to leave the incremental search and
return to the original Point. A Newline command terminates the search
and moves the Point to the match. Any other command causes the search to
terminate and that command to be immediately executed.

<p>Assume the buffer contains the text "Do not panic." and that the Point
is currently on the "D" in "Do".

      <table>
<tr><th>User<th>PAW<th>Point
<tr><td>n<td>		n		<td>"n" in "not"
<tr><td>i		<td>ni		<td>"n" in "panic"
<tr><td>Backspace	<td>n		<td>"n" in "not"
</table>

<p>The last type of search is the expression search. The only command is
the Expression Search. This command prompts for a regular expression to
search for instead of a literal. Regular expressions are discussed in
Section 1.10. Expression searches are much more powerful than literal
searches, but are also slower.

<p>There are two replace commands: Query Replace and Expression Replace.
Query Replace expects a literal search string while the Expression
Replace expects a regular expression search string. The replace string
for Query Replace is also a literal, however the Expression Replace is a
literal with two exceptions. An '&' character in the replace string
causes the matched string to be placed in the buffer instead of the '&'
character itself. For example, if the search string was ".*", and the
replace string was "&&", all lines would be doubled. The escape
character '\' can be used to turn off this special meaning of the '&'.

<p>The replacement commands prompt for a search string and a replacement
string. For each occurrence of the search string, the user is prompted
for what they want to do with the string. The valid responses are:

	<table>
      <tr><th>Key<th>Action
<tr><td>,
<td>Replace current match and ask for confirmation. The confirmation is y/Y
to go ahead with the replace, or n/N to leave the string as it was.

<tr><td>y
<td>Replace current match and continue.

	    <tr><td>&lt;Space&gt;
	  <td>Replace current match and continue.

<tr><td>.
<td>Replace and exit.

<tr><td>!
<td>Replace this and all succeeding occurrences. The editor will no
longer prompt on each occurrence.

<tr><td>C-G (Abort)
<td>Exit without replacing current match.

<tr><td>Others
<td>Continue without replacing current match.
</table>

    <p>The commands are the same for both versions of the replace command.

<p>If a Universal Argument is given to a replace command, it performs a
global replace. Instead of performing the replace on the current Point
to the end of the current buffer, the replacement is performed on ALL of
the buffers in the buffer list.

<p>NOTE: You cannot search for or replace with a string that has a NULL
(ASCII 0) character in it.


<h2>Pattern Matching</h2>

<p>Zedit supports pattern matching using regular expressions (REs). The REs
are the same as the Unix grep command. The rules for created the REs are
described below.

    <ul>
<li>An ordinary character matches itself.

<li>A period (.) matches any one character except Newline.

<li>A non-empty string of characters enclosed in square brackets ([])
matches any one of the characters in the string. If the first character
of the string is a caret (^), it matches any character except the
Newline and the characters in the string. The caret (^) has this special
meaning only if it occurs as the first character after the '['. The
minus (-) may be used to indicate a range of consecutive ASCII
characters; for example, [0-9] is equivalent to [0123456789]. The -
loses this special meaning if it occurs first (after an initial ^, if
any) or last in the string. The right square bracket (]) does not
terminate such a string when it is the first character within it (after
an initial ^, if any); e.g. []a-f] matches either a right square bracket
(]) or one of the characters a through f inclusive. None of the other
special characters are special inside the [].

<li>A backslash (\) escapes a special character.

<li>A one-character RE followed by an asterisk (*) matches zero or more
occurrences of the one-character RE. If there is any choice, the longest
leftmost string that permits a match is chosen.

<li>A one-character RE followed by \{m\}, \{m,\}, or \{m,n\} matches a range
of occurrences of the one-character RE. The values of m and n must be
positive integers less than 256; \{m\} matches exactly m occurrences;
\{m,\} matches at least m occurrences; \{m,n\} matches any number of
occurrences between m and n inclusive. Whenever a choice exists, the RE
matches as many occurrences as possible.

<li>The concatenation of REs is a RE that matches the concatenation of
the strings matched by each component.

<li>A RE enclosed between the character sequences \\( and \\) is a RE that
matches whatever the unadorned RE matches.

<li>The expression \\n matches the same string of characters as was
matched by an expression enclosed between \\( and \\) earlier in the same
RE. Here n is a digit; the sub-expression specified is that beginning
with the n-th occurrence of \\( counting from the left. For example, the
expression ^\\(.*\\)\\1$ matches a line consisting of two repeated
appearances of the same string.

<li>A caret (^) at the beginning of an entire RE constrains that RE to match
an initial segment of a line.

<li>A dollar sign ($) at the end of an entire RE constrains that RE to match
a final segment of a line.
</ul>

<h2>Tag Files</h2>

<p>Tag files are a list of tags, usually function names, and their
associated file name and position in the file. Tag files allow files to
be found by function names instead of file names.

<p>Zedit does not produce the tag files. They must be created by an
external program. The tag file formats supported are:

      <ul>
	<li>&lt;tag&gt; &lt;num&gt;   &lt;fname&gt;
	<li>&lt;tag&gt; &lt;fname&gt; &lt;num&gt;
	<li>&lt;tag&gt; &lt;fname&gt; &lt;match_ch&gt;[^]&lt;search_string&gt;[$][&lt;match_ch&gt;]
    </ul>

<p>The single space shown can actually be any number of spaces and/or tabs
as long as there is at least one space or tab. If the number <num> has a
leading 0 it is assumed to be a byte offset, else a line offset.

<p>The first format is produced by ctags with the -x option. The second is
produced by Microsoft's calltree program. The third format is the ctags
type format. The match_ch is any character except '\'. The '^' and '$'
are optional and match the start of line and end of line respectively.
The ending match_ch is also optional. The search_string ends at the end
of the line. The search string is a literal. '\' characters can be used
to escape the match_ch in the string.

<p>Other programs that produce one of these formats can be used.

<p>The command Find Tag is used to look for a tag in the tags file. If it
finds the tag, it sets a bookmark at the current Point, performs a Find
File with the matched filename, and positions the Point in the opened
file. The first time the Find Tag command is executed, it creates the
".tags" buffer and loads the tags file. The tag file is only loaded
once.

<p>The tag file is loaded into a special buffer called ".tags". This buffer
is editable. If a line in the file needs to be changed, it can be edited
in the ".tags" buffer and saved to disk with the Write File command.

<p>The Tagfile variable is used to find the tag file. The editor first
looks for the tag file in the current directory under the name "tags",
the default output name for the ctags command. If the file is not found,
it looks for the file specified by the Tagfile variable. A Universal
Argument will prompt for the tag file to read.

<p>If Zedit cannot find the tag, it will return the first partial match, if
any. If the tag string is "file" and there is no tag "file" but a tag
"Readfilename" exists, Zedit will reprompt for the tag with
"Readfilename" as the default. The Again command can be used to find the
next partial match.


<h2>Calculator</h2>

<p>Zedit has a built-in six function integer calculator. The calculator is
very simple but useful for doing addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division of decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. The output is
displayed in both decimal and hexadecimal.

<p>The calculator can also be used to convert from decimal, hexadecimal, or
octal to decimal and hexadecimal. Just enter the number to be converted
and hit Newline.

<p>To differentiate between the different bases, hexadecimal numbers begin
with 0x or 0X, octal numbers begin with 0, and decimal numbers begin
with 1 through 9. The bases can be mixed within a given command string.
