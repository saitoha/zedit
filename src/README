README for release 4.2

New Features
------------

The big new feature is the 3D look and menubar! Old X interface still alive.

Zblist / Zfindfile / Zmake / Zvarhelp calls.

Make within editor has been streamlined.

cppifColor highlighting and more color control all around.

Fill Paragraph in C mode (which does a "format comments") now asks are
you sure?

What the buttons do...
----------------------

The buttons are currently hardcoded as follows:
If on modeline
	Left		Page Down Window
	Right		Page Up Window
Else
	Left		Set Point
	Left and Drag	Set Point then Set Mark on release
	Double left	Set Point and Find Tag
	Shift Left	Set Mark
	Middle		Paste
	Right		Set Mark

In SCROLLBARS
	Right		Move point to offset in buffer
	Right and Drag	Move point and scroll

	Note that moving a scrollbar in a window is an implicit switch
	window.

Bug Fixes
---------

- fixed Save Bindings command

- fixed "other window" window updates problem. When redisplaying the
 "other windows" we had two problems:
	1. would not reframe i.e. if point moved window didn't always follow
	2. point could get moved by update routine!

- in cpp "coloring" algo, a certain call to get buffer word routine could go
  into an infinite loop

- many X bugs...

- A '#' that was automagically moved to the start of the line would put
the deleted whitespace in the kill buffer. Now it is deleted to /dev/null.

- A c++ comment after a #define messed up the comment coloring.

- bug with files called "tmp" and write region

- tags of the form ^<line>$ did not match EOL properly

- bolding characters tended to bold too much under Xwindows.

- algo for bolding changed for Xwindows
	if user has color and boldcolor specified
		use boldcolor
	else if bold font specified
		use boldfont
	else
		no bolding

- when switching from C mode buffer to non-C mode buffer, the colour from
the C mode buffer would carry over. Fixed.

- The M-Z command put back in Xwindows version.

Known Bugs
----------

- Scrollbar dosen't handle partial bottom screen well....

- XWINDOWs - see below

- clean up Waiting for SYSV4
	- maybe count of "child" buffers with active pipes
		- only do waitpid when set

- on PC pathfixup for drives untested

- xb.c xb.h still in RCS

- RCS ci not supported


Known X Bugs
------------

- COMMENTBOLD
	- typing */ by itself causes problems
	- at EOB, deleteing last / does not clear comment until * deleted
	- CPP does not handle new lines until a delete command
	- workaround for all comment bold problems: type C-L

- X resource names case sensitive

- kill make on exit does not seem to work

- paste limited to 1M (he he he...)

- get geometry does not make sure window is on screen

- sometimes gets unknown events 18,19,21

- colors are not cached - i.e. using a color mulitple times creates
  multiple definitions of the color
