Look at Wload


- checkmail should use var for timeout

- Rowmax should be for text window
	- paw line
	- modeline

- Zroot has too many events in BORDER3D case

- Dopipe should implement CheckPipes and allow multiple instances!

- Maybe the Unix code should use the new xpipe calls?

- Zfont does not show the fixed size NxN fonts
